                Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you click Online Video, you can paste
                in the embed code for the video you want to add. You can also type a keyword to search online for the
                video that best fits your document.
                To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page, and text
                box designs that complement each other. For example, you can add a matching cover page, header, and
                sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries.
                Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design and choose a new
                Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply
                styles, your headings change to match the new theme.
                Save time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need them. To change the way a picture fits in
                your document, click it and a button for layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table,
                click where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign.
